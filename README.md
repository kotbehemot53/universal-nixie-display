Universal Nixie Display
=======================

This is the central project for the open source software and hardware for the Universal Nixie Display. 
The display is something more than a desktop nixie clock - it can be whatever you want it to be by 
displaying not only time but also weather data or any data you want it to display.

At the moment it is a work in progress.
